# System-Design
* System Design is the process of planning and defining the architecture of a software system.  
* It focuses on how different components like **databases, APIs, caching, load balancers, and microservices interact to build a scalable, reliable, and maintainable system.**

# System Design

## 1. What is System Design?

* Process of planning and creating the architecture of a software system.
* Goal → Build a system that is **scalable, reliable, and maintainable**.
* Example: Designing YouTube (video upload, streaming, recommendations).

## 2. Key Concepts in System Design

* **Scalability** → System grows with traffic (vertical vs horizontal).
* **Reliability** → System works even when parts fail.
* **Availability** → System is up and responding most of the time.
* **Performance** → Low latency, high throughput.
* **Consistency** → Data is same everywhere.
* **Fault Tolerance** → System survives failures.

## 3. Common Components

* **Load Balancer** → Distributes traffic to multiple servers.
* **Cache (Redis, Memcached)** → Speeds up reads.
* **Database (SQL, NoSQL)** → Stores data.
* **Message Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** → Handles async tasks.
* **CDN** → Serves static content globally.
* **API Gateway** → Entry point for microservices.

## 4. Most Asked System Design Questions

* Design **URL Shortener** (bit.ly).
* Design **Chat System** (WhatsApp).
* Design **News Feed** (Facebook/Instagram).
* Design **E-commerce System** (Amazon/Flipkart).
* Design **Payment System** (PayPal).
* Design **Distributed Cache**.
* Design **File Storage System** (Google Drive, Dropbox).

---

## 5. Important Patterns

* **CAP Theorem** (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).
* **Sharding** → Split DB into smaller parts.
* **Replication** → Copy data for reliability.
* **Rate Limiting** → Restrict API requests.
* **Circuit Breaker** → Stop cascading failures.
* **Saga Pattern** → Handle distributed transactions.
* **CQRS + Event Sourcing** → Separate read/write & keep audit history.
